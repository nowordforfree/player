###This is a  media player based on electron and VLC binding to nodejs/electron

It should support playback of variety audio and video formats, but video output is not working yet.

Reminder list:  
[ ] - fix search in playlists (make magnifier icon instead of button)  
[ ] - add missing buttons and bind them to player methods (prev, stop, next)  
[ ] - fix dropdown for adding files (update package when will be fixed dropdown/dropup [github issue 4762](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/issues/4762))
